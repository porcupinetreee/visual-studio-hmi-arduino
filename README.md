# visual-studio-hmi-arduino

Created an HMI using Visual Studio C# which sends one byte of data each time a button transferred. ( more bytes when gauge is used. Since I dont have the sensors, it shows fixed values for debug/test purposes.) 

This HMI is a test for future HMIs that I am planning to design for a self-driving mobile robot.
